# Refinitiv-API
Jupyter notebook code used to access ESG data on Refinitiv API through their native library refinitiv.data, for reference, see https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/api-catalog/refinitiv-data-platform/refinitiv-data-library-for-python

Please note that I cannot provide the csv files "Refinitiv_Codebook.csv" and "Refinitiv_Universe.csv" due to confidentiality constraint. These two files contain the list of Refinitiv variable formulas (that you want to access) and the list of Refinitiv instrument names (that you want to get data for) respectively. You can create them on Refinitiv workspace.
